# 🤖 Self-Evolving Autonomous Agent for Market Alpha Discovery

A next-gen autonomous trading system designed to continuously learn, adapt, and evolve — all with one goal: discovering alpha in real-world financial markets. This project is about going beyond rule-based bots and building a system that **actually learns from the market**, adjusts its own strategies, and makes smart decisions on its own.

## 📘 What This Project Is About

Markets change. A strategy that worked last week might not work tomorrow. That’s why I built this: a **self-evolving trading agent** that doesn’t rely on static rules. Instead, it analyzes live market data, experiments with different approaches, learns from mistakes, and keeps improving.

This system pulls in real-time data (price, volume, sentiment), uses reinforcement learning to figure out what’s working, and adapts its trades — all without manual tweaking. Whether it’s equities, crypto, or simulated assets, the idea is the same: **autonomous alpha discovery**.

## 🧠 What It Can Do

- ✅ Understand live market signals and turn them into actionable insights
- 🔁 Continuously update its strategy based on real-time feedback
- ⚡ Execute trades with low latency, simulating a real trading environment
- 📉 Manage risk dynamically as market conditions evolve
- 📊 Learn from historical performance and adjust behavior accordingly

## 🔍 How It Works (In Simple Terms)

The system has four main pieces:

1. **Market Data Engine**  
   Pulls in live and historical data — price, volume, technical indicators, and optionally even news or sentiment feeds.

2. **Learning Core (Reinforcement Learning)**  
   The agent runs simulations, rewards itself for profitable decisions, and learns better strategies over time.

3. **Strategy Layer**  
   Converts insights into real trading actions. It figures out when to buy, sell, or hold based on the current market context.

4. **Execution Engine**  
   Sends trades to a simulated (or real) market, logs results, and feeds them back into the learning system to keep improving.
